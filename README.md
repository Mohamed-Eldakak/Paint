# Paint
The progam is implemented by applying different Design Patterns (eg: MVC) and also by applying SOLID Principles.

It allows the following functionalities 
for the user on all the shapes : Draw, Color, Resize, 
delete, copy and Move.

• It allows the user to undo 
or redo any action performed.

• The cursor is used to select the location of a shape while 
drawing it, or moving it to another location, for more accurate control 
on the shape parameters.

• For the copy, a shape could be selected for copy, and pasted in any 
other spot of the drawing canvas.
